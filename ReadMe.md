# eudaemon

**E**macs **U**ser **D**aemons

A kind spirit to help with managing Emacs client and server processes.

(A _very_ early work in progress ðŸ‘¼ðŸ‘¹âš )




## Usage

```
eud [list|new NAME|connect [NAME]|kill [NAME|--all]|server-socket-dir-path]
```

where:
`list` shows a list of all running Emacs daemons, with respective PIDs

`new NAME` creates a new Emacs daemon using a socket called NAME

`connect NAME FILE` creates a new Emacs client process (i.e. `emacsclient`) connected to the socket called NAME and visits FILE with Emacs; if no FILE is passed, Emacs will visit the working directory in `dired` mode. Exits and displays an error if FILE does not exist if a daemon process with socket NAME does not exist.

`kill NAME` sends a TERM signal (15) to the Emacs daemon process with socket NAME; `kill --all` does this for all known Emacs daemon processes.

`server-socket-dir-path`  prints the path to the directory where Unix socket files are stored (see below)



## Notes

### Sockets live in `~/emacs.d/sockets` by default
This is only intended to work with Emacs server daemons with Unix socket files (i.e. not TCP). The socket files belonging to any Emacs daemons from `eud` are stored in a single directory (this shall be made configurable). While this is inconsistent with Emacs' own implementation (which allows for the user to set `server-socket-dir` in their Emacs configuration, _or_ for the socket directory to use the environment `$TMPDIR`, _or_ to fall back to the system default temp. directory (typically `/tmp/emacs$(id -u)`). Currently, the socket directory is set to `~/.emacs.d/sockets/` (which will be created by `eud` if it does not already exist). Using a single location for this, explicitly, has the pleasant side-effect of avoiding unix socket files being strewn around various temporary directories (as can happen when using [`nix-shell`](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Development_environment_with_nix-shell) environments, for example).

If `eud` is installed and available on the `PATH`, adding the short snipped below will ensure Emacs always uses this sockets directory:

``` emacs-lisp
(when (executable-find "eud")
  (setq server-socket-dir
	(shell-command-to-string "eud server-socket-dir-path")))
```


## TODOs

 - [ ] `eud` controls only daemons with sockets in prescribed directory (`server-socket-dir`). I can list (--all) daemon processes, but will only _connect_ to ones which are known from this directory (...). Handling this is unnecessary, so long as `server-socket-dir` is set in Emacs' config, but this shouldn't be a requirement.

 - [ ] `tokio::process` for spawning child processes and reading output asynchronously from them

 - [ ] tests de unidad!

 - [ ] shell autocomplete suggestions

 - [ ] reasonable exit codes on error?

 - [ ] given the name, we should really ensure this works with [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs)

 - [ ] nix.

 - [ ] MacOS launchd integration (set default server to launch on login/boot?)

 - [ ] `System::new_all()` from `sysinfo` can probably be slimmed-down

 - [ ] How about a `new` command that creates an instance specifically for a working directory / project?
